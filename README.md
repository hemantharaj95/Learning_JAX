# Learning_JAX
This repository is for learning JAX a machine learning framework.

# What is JAX:
[JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/quickstart.html) is a Machine Learning framework.

# Framework Using JAX
1. Flax (Google) - General-purpose deep learning.
2. Haiku (DeepMind) - Research-focused deep learning.
3. Objax (Google) - Lightweight framework for research.
4. Equinox (Partix Kidger) - Research and differential programming.
5. NumPyro (Pyro team) - Probabilistic programming (Bayesian inference)
6. BlackJAX (PyMC Labs) - Inference algorithms (e.g. HMC, NUTS)
7. TinyGP - Gaussian Processes
8. Optax (DeepMind) - Gradient-based optimization (like PyTorch's torch.optim)
9. Diffrax - Solving differential equations.
10. T5X (Google) - Training large transformer models (e.g. T5)
11. Scenic (Google Research) - Vision models (ViT, DETR, etc.,)
12. Orbax (Google) - Checkpoiniting and I/O for JAX models.
13. Jraph - Lightweight library designed for building graph neural networks (GNN) in JAX.
